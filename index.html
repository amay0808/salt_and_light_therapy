            S.A.L.T. offers telehealth services, which according to California law, is the use of technology to facilitate the delivery of health care services and public health. This includes providing diagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management, and self-management of a patient’s health care while the patient is at the originating site and the health care provider is at the distant site.

Currently, our therapist is experienced in, and/or trained in Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Motivational Interviewing, Solution-Focused Brief Therapy, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Over the course of time, we expect to add to our repertoire of therapeutic modalities and, also, to strengthen our current modalities through additional training and consultation with other licensed professionals.

                S.A.L.T. only accepts direct payment, but clients may seek reimbursement from their insurance provider for mental health services. S.A.L.T. can provide clients with a superbill, which includes the date of service and diagnosis codes, to facilitate insurance reimbursement.

                S.A.L.T. therapists are licensed to practice in California and provide services to residents of California. For those outside California, therapists may provide telehealth services if they meet the requirements to provide services in that jurisdiction and delivery of services via telehealth is allowed. It is the therapist's responsibility to verify this information.

              </h3>
              <p class="card__text">
                S.A.L.T. integrates evidence-based psychotherapy with Biblical principles for spiritual growth. Unlike secular therapists, we prioritize discipleship and pray with clients. Our approach aligns with Christ's command to make disciples of all nations. (Matthew 28:19-20 NIV)

                I don’t believe in Jesus. Is S.A.L.T. still useful for me?

              <p class="card__text">
                At S.A.L.T., we believe every person has intrinsic worth, regardless of their beliefs. During an intake assessment, our therapists will ask if you'd like to discuss the Bible or include Christian faith in your sessions. We'll respect your decision not to.
