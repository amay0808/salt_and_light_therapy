            S.A.L.T. offers telehealth services, which according to California law, is the use of technology to facilitate the delivery of health care services and public health. This includes providing diagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management, and self-management of a patient’s health care while the patient is at the originating site and the health care provider is at the distant site.

Currently, our therapist is experienced in, and/or trained in Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Motivational Interviewing, Solution-Focused Brief Therapy, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Over the course of time, we expect to add to our repertoire of therapeutic modalities and, also, to strengthen our current modalities through additional training and consultation with other licensed professionals.

                S.A.L.T. only accepts direct payment, but clients may seek reimbursement from their insurance provider for mental health services. S.A.L.T. can provide clients with a superbill, which includes the date of service and diagnosis codes, to facilitate insurance reimbursement.

                S.A.L.T. therapists are licensed to practice in California and provide services to residents of California. For those outside California, therapists may provide telehealth services if they meet the requirements to provide services in that jurisdiction and delivery of services via telehealth is allowed. It is the therapist's responsibility to verify this information.

              <p class="card__text">
                S.A.L.T. integrates evidence-based psychotherapy with Biblical principles for spiritual growth. Unlike secular therapists, we prioritize discipleship and pray with clients. Our approach aligns with Christ's command to make disciples of all nations. (Matthew 28:19-20 NIV)

              <p class="card__text">
                At S.A.L.T., we believe every person has intrinsic worth, regardless of their beliefs. During an intake assessment, our therapists will ask if you'd like to discuss the Bible or include Christian faith in your sessions. We'll respect your decision not to.

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p class="about__paragraph">
                      Hi! My name is Vanessa Nelson and I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW #: 97455)  in the State of California. I graduated from California State University, Stanislaus, in May 2016 with a Master’s Degree in Social Work. I became licensed as a Clinical Social Worker in October 2020.</p>
                
                  
                  <p class="about__paragraph">I have been in the Social Work field since 2013, and am passionate about helping others. I have worked with children, adolescents, adults, and families of different backgrounds, especially those in marginalized groups. As for my personal life, I am married to a wonderful God-fearing man, and have been blessed with three children - a teenage boy, a preteen girl, and a toddler girl. Fun (and challenging)!!! </p>
                  
                
                  <p class="about__paragraph">Aside from attending to my calling as a wife and mother, I enjoy serving in my local church and am involved with my congregation’s Women’s Ministry, Family Support Ministry, and Pastoral On-call. Recreationally, I enjoy travel and sight-seeing, reading books, hiking (nothing too extreme!), movies, thrifting, decorating, and exercise (though, I have a difficult time with cardio!). I am both thrilled and honored to be able to serve the body of believers through the skills and gifts that the Lord has granted me.</p></div>
